# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard  

A data visualization project that analyzes **Heart Failure Clinical Records** to uncover insights about survival rates, risk factors, and patient health trends.  

## Project Overview  
This dashboard was built to study **heart disease survival trends** and the impact of key medical and lifestyle factors. The dataset contains **299 patient records**, including age, smoking habits, serum creatinine levels, ejection fraction, diabetes, anemia, and high blood pressure.  

The dashboard highlights:  
-  Overall survival rate and average age of survival  
-  Impact of **age groups** on survival rate  
-  Effect of **serum creatinine** and **ejection fraction** on survival  
-  Influence of **smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and anemia**  
-  Key patterns across different patient demographics  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
**Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling, transformation, and visualization  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Survival rate calculations & KPIs  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)  
- **Excel/CSV** – Raw data handling  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is publicly available:  
🔗 [Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset – UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records)  


## 🚀 Key Insights  
- 🔹 Survival Rate: **67.89%**  
- 🔹 Average Age of Survival: **58.7 years**  
- 🔹 Lowest Survival Rate: **71+ age group (40.38%)**  
- 🔹 High-risk factors: Smoking, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Anemia  
- 🔹 Patients aged **51–70 years** with high serum creatinine & low ejection fraction face the greatest vulnerability  

## ✨ Learnings & Takeaways  
- Improved skills in **data storytelling and visualization**  
- Hands-on practice with **healthcare analytics**  
- Experience in building **interactive dashboards** that highlight critical insights  

## 🔹 Key Questions Answered  
- What is the **overall survival rate** of heart failure patients?  
- How does **age affect survival outcomes**?  
- Which **medical conditions** (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, anemia) increase mortality risk?  
- How do **serum creatinine** and **ejection fraction** affect survival?  
- Which patient groups are **most vulnerable**?  

## 🔹 Business/Healthcare Impact & Insights  
- Helps identify **high-risk patient groups** for preventive care  
- Supports **doctors & researchers** in understanding critical risk factors  
- Provides **data-driven insights** for healthcare policy and awareness  
- Demonstrates the power of **data visualization in healthcare**
